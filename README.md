### 1. Alpha Beta Pruning

The implementation of Alpha Beta Pruning that was devised for this project is more time efficient than the base MiniMax agent without losing out on the effect on gameplay. When both agents are setup to only search down to the same depth, the agent with Alpha Beta Pruning always completes it's moves quicker. This allows it to look down at further depths of the decision tree and preform better than the base minimax agent.

With the search depth set at 4 I found that the Alpha Beta Agent made its decisions for each move more than twice as fast as the base agent with an average decision time of 0.2 seconds while the base agent had an average of 0.56 seconds.



### 2. Beam Search
